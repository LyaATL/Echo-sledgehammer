# Echo sledgehammer

A simple centralized server to sync and update a global ban list.
People that host their own echo-service instance will be able to submit a ban made on their own service to be included in the global list.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to maintain a trusted, shared list of banned users across multiple echo-service instances.
This reduces the risk of harmful actors simply moving from one service to another after being banned locally.
Sledgehammer wil also inform echo-service instances of new/fresh players, to easily inform administrators/moderators.

## Criteria for Global Ban

A global ban is only applied in cases of severe and verified misconduct.
While local bans may vary depending on a hostâ€™s rules, inclusion in the global ban list is reserved for actions such as (but not limited to):

- Child exploitation or pedophilia (e.g., possession, sharing, or promotion of such material)
- Sexual assault, harassment, or grooming
- Terrorism-related activity (organizing, recruiting, or promoting violent extremism)
- Severe threats of violence or credible intent to harm others
- Distribution of malware, botnets, or large-scale attacks against other services
- Identity theft, fraud, or large-scale scams
- Organized hate speech (targeted campaigns based on race, religion, gender, sexuality, etc.)

These bans are intended to protect the entire community from individuals who pose a significant risk across platforms.

## How It Works

Each host can ban users locally according to their own rules.
When a ban meets the global criteria, the host may submit it to the centralized server.

Submissions are verified and, if approved, propagated to the global ban list.
Other echo-service instances can sync this list to keep their communities safe.

## Privacy & Data Collection Disclaimer

The Echo sledgehammer system requires a way to map and match players to enforce bans consistently across services. This mapping is done by the client plugin (running within FFXIV via Dalamud) sending identifying information to an echo-service instance.

### What Information Is Collected

To remain as privacy-neutral as possible, we avoid gathering sensitive or personally identifying data. Instead, we rely on in-game identifiers that are already public in FFXIV. Examples include:
- Character Name (as displayed in-game)
- World / Data Center (to disambiguate players with the same name)
- Character ID / Lodestone ID (publicly available numeric ID tied to Lodestone profiles)

### What Information Is Not Collected

We do not collect or transmit:
- Hardware identifiers (HWID, MAC, serial numbers, etc.)
- Email addresses or account credentials
- Chat logs or personal messages
- Any other personal data outside the game context

## Privacy Commitments

Data sent to the echo-service is the minimum necessary to uniquely identify a character for ban purposes.
All ban entries must include the reason for the ban, but no additional personal data.
Players should be made aware when a plugin is transmitting ban-related information.
This ensures the global ban system remains effective without compromising player privacy.

## Notes
Transparency: Ban reasons should be clearly documented when submitted.<br/>
Appeals: If appropriate, processes for disputing or reviewing global bans should be implemented.<br/>
Security: The system should prevent abuse of the submission mechanism (e.g., requiring signatures, moderator authentication, or quorum approval).<br/>
